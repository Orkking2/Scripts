# Scripts

I'm teaching myself C++ at the moment. 
These are just some projects I tried out making just for fun. 
They are completely open source but somehow I doubt anyone will find them useful, if you do, feel free to use them! (Do credit me if you don't mind)
Either way, take my code with a bit of a grain of salt. I'm sure there are tons of ways to improve them and make them more efficient. 
I'm also planning on moving on to other languages for the sake of efficiency, so be on the lookout!
